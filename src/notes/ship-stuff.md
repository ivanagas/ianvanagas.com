Everything atrophies without shipping. Your skills, [identity](https://sive.rs/expire), self-belief, momentum. 

Every day you don't ship something, you slip deeper into a hole. It is so easy to get busy and distracted and let days, weeks, months, and years slip by. "Maybe tomorrow" you tell yourself. Tomorrow never comes. Time moves on whether you ship or not.

Although shipping something small each day might feel like nothing, [looking back is magical](https://www.internetvin.tv/my-experiments). I always feel the pressure to have some sort of plan or strategy for what I'm doing. Other people seem to have it. In reality, they don't. They are narrativizing looking backwards. 

Just practice presence. Be here now. Be here today. Tap into the feeling of having a rock in your shoe. Suddenly, you feel something you have not thought about. Your feet are always there, but it takes a rock for you to feel them.

Shipping is that rock. It creates presence, it creates flow, and it builds strength. [Don't end days with zero](https://marginalrevolution.com/marginalrevolution/2005/06/simple_career_a.html).

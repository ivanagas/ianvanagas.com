We take for granted many of the **categories** of tech companies that exist: customer success, product analytics, data cloud, devops, revenue intelligence, inbound marketing, observability, headless CMS, CDP. At some point, none of these existed.

Someone (usually a company) [made them up](https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/source-i-made-it-up) and popularized them, but how?

- **Category definition happens after the behavior is defined.** By the time a category is defined, people are already doing it. The functionality to help them do it exists, usually by the company doing the definition.
- **Category definition consolidates.** Take a bunch of different concepts, functions, ideas, and even categories, and combine them into one. The goal is to raise the prestige of this collection, ‚Äúshifts the convo up a level.‚Äù
- **Basically take two, max three, words.** Usually a new combination of related words customers and employees are already using. Revenue orgs and business intelligence already existed when [Gong](https://pocketcasts.com/podcasts/cdaaa340-db7d-013d-46e2-02bb5ef11301/9597fa7b-529a-4574-9891-781ab3e8751f) coined revenue intelligence.
- **They go all-in:** When companies choose this path, they invest a lot in making sure it sticks. Qualtrics invested a ton in making experience management a thing, branding all their marketing, being [a key part of their IPO](https://www.qualtrics.com/blog/qualtrics-ipo/) (ticker `$XM`).
- **Lots of content.** Not just blog posts, but events, talks, frameworks, benchmarks, industry reports, job titles, LinkedIn skills, and expert analysis. All of these are legitimizing.

What happens after you define a category (successfully)?

- **The ecosystem anchors on you.** Every category has an ecosystem of companies playing different roles, specializing in different areas, but they all anchor on the original definition.
- **You‚Äôre a part of every conversation.** When people talk about the category, you‚Äôll always be part of the comparison. ‚ÄúHow is this different from X?‚Äù
- **A new budget line is created.** Suddenly companies are considering a new budget for the category you‚Äôve defined. Others (hopefully) are doing it. ‚ÄúThis isn‚Äôt X or Y, but a secret third thing.‚Äù
- **Good for SEO.** Experience management software gets 3,600 searches per month with Qualtrics ranking first. Revenue intelligence gets 1,900 searches per month (Gong only ranks third üò¢).
- **The pull of consistency.** Category defining companies are often permanently connected in people‚Äôs minds. This becomes an anchor, which is great if what you‚Äôre doing is working, but not so much if not.

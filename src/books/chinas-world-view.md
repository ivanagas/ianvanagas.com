There are a ton of fees and limits on traditional, gas cars as well as subsidies on electric cars which is probably the reason why electric car companies have done so well in China.

Why China is not a bubble: market economy has taken root, average income is still only 20% of US, and yet average levels of education and health of population are similar to US, and the political regime enjoys popular support (even from the elites).

For many Chinese, the goal of going abroad is to return with fortune and glory instead of occupying foreign land and making it our home.

Was philosophy by dialogue the invention of philosophy? If you look at philosophy as the exploration of shared truths, it seems like it.

Socrates uses “Heracles!” as an exclamation. He also might be the original user of the word “horsey.”

Socrates diminishes the importance of the gods through reasoning. By diminishing piety, you diminish the importance of the gods. If you see the gods as a foundations of society, this means he weakens the foundations. Seems reasonable of the people in power to try to stop this.

Socrates figures out he is the smartest man in Athens by asking all the smart people to explain their preferred subject and then realizing that he is the only one who realizes he doesn’t know anything.

Enjoyed [Professor Kozlowski’s lectures](https://professorkozlowski.wordpress.com/home/intro-to-philosophy/) on Euthyphro. Put into perspective why these texts are important. Drove home why “piety” is an important concept.

If you’re so smart, why can’t you stay alive? Socrates is truly principled and serious about those principles in a way that sticks out in history.

“The fear of death is simply this, thinking yourself wise when you are not; it’s thinking you know what you don’t know. Death may even be the greatest of all good things for a human being – no one knows.”
